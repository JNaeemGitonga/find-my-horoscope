# Find My Scope!

## About

This app is a full stack javascript app that is meant to show my skill in passport-jwt authentication and proficiency in React-Redux. It gives users the ability to log in using Facebook or creating an account and use our app to get their horoscope. It has more fun/motivational quotes than horoscopes.

## Getting started

`$ clone` this repo <br/>
`$ npm start`<br/>
`$ npm run dev`<br/>

App will be listening on port `localhost:8080`
